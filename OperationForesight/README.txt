Hello!
Welcome to OperationForesight, scripted by Yami!
To begin you're going to want to run 'keygen.sh' on the machine you want to recieve the logs parsed!
Afterwards you'll need to copy the 'MetaSploit' folder onto the MetaSploitable box you want to get the logs from and run the 'MetaSploit_Setup' script!
Finally you'll want to run the 'Ubuntu_setup' script and viola!
Everything should be setup and run fine out of the box after you complete the scripts!
Good Luck :)
